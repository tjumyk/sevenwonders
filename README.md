============

My early game project using JavaFx 2.0

~~Since its big size, the files currently stay at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/7-wonders-in-java/)~~

Updates
----------
Google Code is shutting down, so I decided to move the source code here.

I will try to fix some severe issues to make it runnable under the latest Java runtime and reorganize source files in Maven's flavour for the universal deployment , but this is only for the memory.

For historical bug fixes and further improvements... I prefer a total rewrite.
