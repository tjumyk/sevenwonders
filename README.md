============

My early game project using ~~JavaFx 2.0~~ (Now adapted to Java8)

~~Since its big size, the files currently stay at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/7-wonders-in-java/)~~

Updates
----------
Google Code is shutting down, so I decided to move the source code here.

I ~~will try to fix~~ (should have fixed) some severe issues to make it runnable under the latest Java runtime and reorganize source files in Maven's flavour for the universal deployment , but this is only for the memory.

For other historical bug fixes and further improvements... I prefer a total rewrite if I have enough free time.

Nevertheless, if you are interested, feel free to fork and play with it. :)
